
About
-----

This version of PicoDrive is another enhanced version of Dave's
Megadrive / Genesis emulator for Pocket PC. The original Dave's code was
heavily modified (including Cyclone core), parts of it were rewritten in
asm, many features added, accuracy increased. This version is aimed at
ARM-based handheld devices, so ports exist for GP2X handheld console,
Symbian smartphones and PocketPC devices.


How to make it run
------------------

GP2X:
Copy PicoDrive.gpe, code940.bin and mmuhack.o to any place in your filesystem
(all 3 files must be in the same directory) and run PicoDrive.gpe.
Then load a ROM and enjoy!

Symbian:
Select PicoDrive from application (tools) menu and run it. That's it!

All:
If you have any problems (game does not boot, sound is glitchy, broken graphics),
make sure you enable "Accurate timing", "Emulate Z80" and then disable
"Fast renderer". This way you will get the best compatibility this emulator can
provide.


Configuration
-------------

See config.txt file.


Problems / limitations
----------------------

* 32x, Sega CD, SVP are not emulated.
* Various VDP quirks (window bug, scroll size 2, etc.) are not emulated,
  as very few games use this.
* Some games don't work or have glitches because of inaccurate timing and sync
  between the emulated chips.

Changelog
---------
0.964
  * GP2X: Fixed a sound buffer underflow issue on lower sample rate modes, which was
          happening for NTSC games and causing sound clicks.
  * GP2X: Redone key config to better support USB joysticks (now multiple joysticks
          should be useable and configurable).
  + GP2X: Added save confirmation option.
  + GP2X: Added 940 CPU crash detection.
  + ALL:  UIQ3 port added.

0.963
  * GP2X: Gamma-reset-on-entering-menu bug fixed.
  * GP2X: Recompiled PicoDrive with gcc profiling option set as described here:
          http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?showtopic=28490

0.962
  * GP2X: Fixed an issue with incorrect sounds in some games when dualcore operation
          was enabled (for example punch sound in SOR).
  * GP2X: Limited max volume to 90, because higher values often cause distortions.
  * GP2X: Fixed a bug with lower res scaling.
  * GP2X: Gamma is now reset on exit.

0.96
  * ALL:  Severely optimized MAME's YM2612 core, part of it is now rewritten in asm.
  + GP2X: The YM2612's code now can be run in GP2X's ARM940T CPU, what causes large
          performance increase.
  * ALL:  Accurate renderers are slightly faster now.
  + GP2X: Using quadruple buffering instead of doublebuffer now, also updated
          framelimitter, this should eliminate some scrolling and tearing problems.
  * GP2X: Fixed some flickering issues of 8bit accurate renderer.
  + GP2X: craigix's RAM timings now can be enabled in the menu (see advanced options).
  + GP2X: Added ability to save config for specific games only.
  + GP2X: Gamma control added (using GP2X's hardware capabilities for this).
  * GP2X: Volume keys are now configurable.
  + GP2X: GnoStiC added USB joystick support, I made it possible to use it for
          player 2 control (currently untested).
  * GP2X: squidgehack is now applied through kernel module (cleaner way).

0.95
  * ALL:  Fixed a bug in sprite renderer which was causing slowdowns for some games.
  + GP2X: Added command line support
  + GP2X: Added optional hardware scaling for lower-res games like Shining Force.
  * ALL:  Sound chips are now sampled 2 times per frame. This fixed some games which
          had missing sounds (Vectorman 2 1st level, Thunder Force 3 water level,
	      etc.).
  + ALL:  Added another accurate 8-bit renderer which is slightly faster and made it
          default.

0.945
  + GP2X: Added frame limiter for frameskipped modes.
  * GP2X: Increased brightness a bit (unused pixel bits now also contain data).
  * GP2X: Suidgehack was not applied correctly (was applied before allocating some
          high memory and had no effect).

0.94
  + Added GP2X port.
  * Improved interrupt timing, Mazin Saga and Burning Force now works.
  * Rewritten renderer code to better suit GP2X, should be faster on other
    ports too.
  + Added support for banking used by 12-in-1 and 4-in-1 ROMs (thanks Haze).
  + Added some protection device faking, used by some unlicensed games like
    Super Bubble Bobble, King of Fighters, Elf Wor, ... (thanks to Haze again)
  + Added primitive Virtua Racing SVP faking, so menus can be seen now.

0.93
  * Fixed a problem with P900/P910 key configuration in FC mode.
  * Improved shadow/hilight mode emulation. Still not perfect, but should be
    enough for most games.
  + Save state slots added.
  + Region selector added.

0.92
  VDP changes:
  * VDP emulation is now more accurate (fixes flickering in Chase HQ II,
    Super Hang-On and some other problems in other games).
  * HV counter emulation is now much more accurate. Fixes the Asterix games,
    line in Road Rash 3, etc.
  * Minor sprite and layer scroll masking bugs fixed.
  + Added partial interlace mode renderer (Sonic 2 vs mode)
  * Fixed a crash in both renderers when certain size window layers were used.
  + Added emulation of shadow/hilight operator sprites. Other shadow/hilight
    effects are still unemulated.
  + Sprite emulation is more accurate, sprite limit is emulated.
  + Added "accurate sprites" option, which always draws sprites in correct
    order and emulates sprite collision bit, but is significantly slower.

  Emulation changes:
  * Improved interrupt handling, added deferred interrupt emulation
    (Lemmings, etc).
  + Added serial EEPROM SRAM support (Wonder Boy in Monster World,
    Megaman - The Wily Wars and many EA sports games like NBA Jam).
  + Implemented ROM banking for Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers
  * Updated to the latest version of DrZ80 core, integrated memory handlers
    in it for better performance. A noticeable performance increase, but save
	states may not work from the previous version (you can only use them with
	sound disabled in that case).
  + SRAM word read handler was using incorrect byte order, fixed.

  Changes in Cyclone 0.0086:
  + Added missing CHK opcode handler (used by SeaQuest DSV).
  + Added missing TAS opcode handler (Gargoyles,Bubba N Stix,...). As in real genesis,
    memory write-back phase is ignored (but can be enabled in config.h if needed).
  + Added missing NBCD and TRAPV opcode handlers.
  + Added missing addressing mode for CMP/EOR.
  + Added some minor optimizations.
  - Removed 216 handlers for 2927 opcodes which were generated for invalid addressing modes.
  + Fixed flags for ASL, NEG, NEGX, DIVU, ADDX, SUBX, ROXR.
  + Bugs fixed in MOVEP, LINK, ADDQ, DIVS handlers.
  * Undocumented flags for CHK, ABCD, SBCD and NBCD are now emulated the same way as in Musashi.
  + Added Uninitialized Interrupt emulation.
  + Altered timing for about half of opcodes to match Musashi's.

0.80
  * Nearly all VDP code was rewritten in ARM asm. Gives ~10-25% performance
    increase (depends on game).
  * Optimized 32-column renderer not to render tiles offscreen, games which
    use 32-column display (like Shining Force) run ~50% faster.
  + Added new "Alternative renderer", which gives another ~30-45% performance
    increase (in addition to mentioned above), but works only with some games,
    because it is missing some features (it uses tile-based renderering
    instead of default line-based and disables H-ints).
  + Added "fit2" display mode for all FC gamers. It always uses 208x146 for
    P800 and 208x208 for all other phones.
  + Added volume control for Motorolas (experimental).

  VDP changes:
  + Added support for vertical window (used by Vapor Trail, Mercs, GRIND
    Stormer and others).
  + Added sprite masking (hiding), adds some speed.
  + Added preliminary H counter emulation. Comix Zone and Sonic 3D Blast
    special stage are now playable.
  + Added column based vertical scrolling (Gunstar Heroes battleship level,
    Sonic and Knuckles lava boss, etc).

  Emulation changes:
  + Re-added and improved Z80 faking when Z80 is disabled. Many games now can
    be played without enabling Z80 (Lost Vikings, Syndicate, etc), but some
    still need it (International Superstar Soccer Deluxe).
  * Improved ym2612 timers, Outrun music plays at correct speed, voices in
    Earthworm Jim play better, more games play sound.
  * I/O registers now remember their values (needed for Pirates! Gold)
  + Added support for 6 button pad.

  Changes in Cyclone 0.0083wip:
  + Added missing CHK opcode (used by SeaQuest DSV).
  + Added missing TAS opcode (Gargoyles). As in real genesis, write-back phase
    is ignored (but is enabled for other systems).

  Backported stuff from Snes9x:
  * Fixed Pxxx jog up/down which were not working in game.
  + Added an option to gzip save states to save space.
  + The emulator now pauses whenever it is loosing focus, so it will now pause
    when alarm/ponecall/battery low/... windows come up.
  - Removed 'pause on phonecall' feature, as it is no longer needed.
  + Video fix for asian A1000s.

0.70
  * Started using tools from "Symbian GCC Improvement Project", which give
    considerable speed increase (~4fps in "center 90" mode).
  * Rewrote some drawing routines in ARM assembly (gives ~6 more fps in
    "center 90" mode).
  * Minor improvement to 0 and 180 "fit" modes. Now they look slightly better
    and are faster.
  * Minor stability improvements (emulator is less likely to crash).
  + Added some background for OSD text for better readability.
  + Added Pal/NTSC detection. This is needed for proper sound speed.
  + Implemented Reesy's DrZ80 Z80 emu. Made some changes to it with hope to make
    it faster.
  + Implemented ym2612 emu from the MAME project. Runs well but sometimes sounds
    a bit weird. Could be a little faster, so made some changes too.
  + Implemented SN76489 emu from the MAME project.
  + Added two separate sound output methods (mediaserver and cmaudiofb) with
    autodetection (needs testing).
  * Fixed VDP DMA fill emulation (as described in Charles MacDonald's docs),
    fixes Contra and some other games.

0.301
  Launcher:
  * Launcher now starts emulation process from current directory,
    not from hardcoded paths.
  * Improved 'pause on call' feature, should hopefully work with Motorola phones.

0.30
  Initial release.


About
-----

This is a quick windows port of PicoDrive, a Megadrive / Genesis emulator for
handheld devices. It was originally coded having ARM CPU based devices in mind
(most work was done on GP2X version), but there is also a PSP port.

The sole purpose of this port is to demonstrate my SVP emulation code. This
makes it one of the most minimal emulators out there. If you need more
features, you will have to wait until SVP support is integrated in Kega, Gens
and the likes, as this emu was not meant to compete with them.

Credits
-------

A lot of work on making SVP emulation happen was done by Tasco Deluxe, my
stuff is a continuation of his.
The original PicoDrive was written by fDave from finalburn.com

This PicoDrive version uses bits and pieces of from other projects:

68k: FAME/C core, by Chui and Stéphane Dallongeville (as C68K).
z80: CZ80 by Stéphane Dallongeville and modified by NJ.
YM2612 and SN76496 cores: MAME devs.

Greets to all the sceners and emu authors out there!
